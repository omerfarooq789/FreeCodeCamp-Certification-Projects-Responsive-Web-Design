                    <h3>
                        Edhi’s Early Life:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Abdul Sattar Edhi was Born on 28th Feburary 1928 in a small village of Bantva near Joona Garh, Gujrat (India). 
                        When Edhi was at the tender age of eleven, his mother became paralysed and later got mentally ill. 
                        Young Abdul Sattar devoted himself for looking after all her needs; cleaning, bathing, changing clothes and feeding. 
                        This proved to be a loosing battle against the disease, and her helplessness increased over the years. 
                        Her persistent woeful condition left a lasting impression on young Edhi.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Edhi’s mother died when he was 19. 
                        The course of his life took a different turn from other persons of his age. 
                        His studies were also seriously affected and he could not complete his high school level. 
                        For him the world of suffering became his tutor and source of wisdom. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h3>
                        His Mission:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        His personal experience made him think of thousands and millions, suffering like his mother, around with nobody to look after them.
                        Even at this early age, he felt personally responsible for taking on the challenge of developing a system of services to reduce human miseries. 
                        The task was huge he had no resources.  
                        He thought that he had a call to help these people.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He had a vision of chains of welfare centres and hospitals that could be opened to alleviate the pain of those suffering from illness and neglect. 
                        He also thought of the in-human treatment meted out to the mentally ill, the insane and the disabled persons. 
                        But it was some thing that he had to do even if he had to walk to the streets if he had to beg for this purpose.

                    <h3>
                        Edhi’s Life Style:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Despite his enormous fame and the vast sums of money that passes through his hands, Edhi adheres to a very simple and modest life style. 
                        He and his family live in a two room apartment adjacent to the premises of Foundation’s headquarter. 
                        Neither Edhi nor Bilquis receives any salary. 
                        They live on the income from government securities that Edhi bought many years ago to take care of their personal needs for the rest of their lives, 
                        thereby freeing them to devote single mindedly to their missionary work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Edhi’s Early Career:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Edhi and his family migrated to Pakistan in 1947. 
                        He became a commission agent selling clothes in the wholesale market in Karachi. 
                        After a couple of years, he left this occupation and with the support of some members of his community decided to establish a free dispensary. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He became involved in this charity work. 
                        However, soon his personal vision of a growing and developing system of multifarious services made 
                        him decide to establish a welfare trust of his own and named it as “Edhi Trust” later known as "Edhi Foundation". 
                        He opened his first clinic in 1951
                    </p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h3>
                        Public Support:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        
                        An appeal was made to the public for funds. The response was good, and Rs.200,000/- were raised. 
                        The range and scope of work of Edhi Trust expanded with remarkable speed under the driving spirit of the man behind it. 
                        A maternity home was established and emergency ambulance service was started in the sprawling metropolis of Karachi with a population of over 10 million.
                        More donations were received as people’s confidence in the activities of the Trust grew.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Edhi’s Married Life:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Abdul Sattar Edhi was married in 1965 to Bilquis, a nurse who worked at the Edhi dispensary. 
                        The couple have four children, two daughters and two sons. 
                        Bilquis runs the free maternity home at the headquarter in Karachi and organises the adoption of illegitimate and abandoned babies. 
                        The husband-wife team has come to share the common vision of single minded devotion to the cause of alleviation of human sufferings 
                        and a sense of personal responsibility to respond to each call for help, regardless of race, creed or status.
